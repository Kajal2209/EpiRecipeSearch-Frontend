# EpiRecipeSearch Frontend

## Project Description

**EpiRecipeSearch** is a recipe search application that allows users to explore various recipes by searching with keywords. It fetches recipe details such as nutritional information and images from the backend, displaying them in a user-friendly and responsive interface. This React-based frontend is designed to work seamlessly with the Flask backend and leverages the Pexels API for high-quality recipe images.

## Objectives

- Provide a simple search interface for users to find recipes.
- Display detailed nutritional information (calories, fat, protein, etc.) for each recipe.
- Display recipe images fetched from the Pexels API.
- Responsive design for easy access on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/))
- Flask backend running (see backend repo for instructions)

### Steps to Setup the Frontend

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kajal2209/EpiRecipeSearch-Frontend.git
    cd EpiRecipeSearch-Frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you are in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the API Endpoint**:
   If necessary, update the backend API URL in the `.env` file or the Axios configuration to match your Flask backendâ€™s address (default is `http://localhost:5000`).

4. **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   This will start the frontend development server, which should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
